- Queues are one of the simplest data structures. 

- They are commonly used as a buffer or queueing system. 

- Here are the **functions associated with a queue**: 

    - **Enqueue**: ***Add an element to the back of the queue***. 

    - **Dequeue**: ***Remove an element at the front of the queue***. 

    - **Peek**: ***Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it from the queue***. 

    - **Size**: ***Get the size of the queue***. 

    - **IsEmpty**: ***Check if the queue is empty***.
