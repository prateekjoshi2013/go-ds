### Stack

- A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) ordered list. 

- You add elements at the top of the stack and get elements from the top of the stack as well. 

- Stacks are very important in programming, especially in memory management. 

- Theyâ€™re also used for creating recursive functions, expression evaluation, and backtracking. 

- Here are the functions associated with a stack: 
  
  - **Push**: *Add an element to the top of the stack*. 
  
  - **Pop**: *Remove an element at the top of the stack*. 
  
  - **Peek**: *Get the element at the top of the stack without removing it*.
  
  - **Size**: *Get the size of the stack*. 
  
  - **IsEmpty**: *Check if the stack is empty*.
